Mission goal
============

The workers are organised into partitions, sets of workers that share the same skills or are obey the same policies. For instance, there is a maximum time that a job is allowed to take before completion.

The goal of the mission is to discover the default partition and its time limit. The default partition is the set of workers to which a job will be submitted if the partition is not specified explicitly. It is marked with an asterisk.


Useful commands
===============

sinfo -s
  lists the partitions defined in the system.
  The (A/I/O/T) column stands for number of workers in the
  states Allocated, Idle, and Other and the T is for Total.
  

Remarks
-------

Slurm has a specific syntax for expressing time:
 days-hours:minutes:seconds.

Also, the workers like to call themselves 'nodes'.
