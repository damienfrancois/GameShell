Mission goal
============

You have now submitted a job. Upon completion, the worker will create
one or two file(s) in the directory where you issued the sbatch command.
Those files will contain the standard output (and standard error if any)
of the operations listed in the job. 

To pass this mission, wait until your job has completed, and look for the
output file. Its name follows the format slurm-JJJJJJJ.out where JJJJJJ is
the job ID. It should contain the name of the worker. That information is
the key to the next mission.

To check whether your job has completed, is running, or is still pending, use
the squeue command. 
 Once a job is completed, or failed, it exists the queue.

Useful commands
===============

squeue --me

Lists all of your job in the queue. 

cat

shows the contents of a file.
