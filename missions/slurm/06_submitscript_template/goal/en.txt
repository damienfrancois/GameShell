Mission goal
============

To get a worker to work for you, you need to write a work order, also called a submission script. The submission script is a shell script (often a Bash script) that contains information about the work to do. 

It must start with a shebang, that is a line such as

   #!/bin/bash

that indicates the path to the interpreter to use for the script.

To complete the mission, create a directory named testjob with a submission script in it named submit.sh The submission script should only contain a shebang.

Useful commands
===============

vim, nano
    Both Vim and Nano are text editor that allow creating files in a terminal with a pure text interface. Learning about them is out of the scope of this tutorial.

Remarks
-------

Make sure the directory is properly created and the file is named submit.sh and only contain the shebang line.
