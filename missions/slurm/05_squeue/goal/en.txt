Mission goal
============

Find out about the list of jobs currently managed by Slurm. Jobs are identified by a numerical job ID. Some of them are currently being worked on by the workers, they are in the R (Running) state. The others are in the PD (PenDing) state. Jobs can be given names to better recognize them. The jobs that will start next are the one that have "(Resources)" as listed "reason".

What is the job ID of the next job to start in the default partition?

Useful commands
===============

squeue
  lists the jobs in the system. Most column titles are self-explanatory. The last one will show which worker(s) are buzy with that job, or, in parenthese, the reason why no worker is taking care of it. 

squeue -t PD
  shows only the jobs that are pending

squeue -p partition
  shows only jobs submitted to that partition

Remarks
-------

You will need to combine both arguments to get the correct answer.

Beware that as the environment is changing with jobs completing and others being submitted, you need to run the gsh check command with no delay once you have the answer to the question.
