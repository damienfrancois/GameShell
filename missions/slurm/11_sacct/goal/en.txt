Mission goal
============

Slurm's accounting stores a lot of information about your job

The goal of the mission is to use the sacct command to retrieve information about your job and compare resource request and usage, with respect to CPU, memory and also time.

Useful information
==================

sacct - query accounting database. This command has a `--format` parameter to choose which columns to display. Useful columns include:

ReqMem: Requested memory 
MaxRSS: Actually-used memory 
Timelimit: Requested time limit
Elapsed: Actual time used by the job
AllocCPUS: number of CPUs allocated to the job
CPUTime: amount of CPU hours allocated to job
TotalCPU: amount of CPUtime actually consumed

For instance: 

sacct --format jobid,state,ReqMem,MaxRSS,Timelimit,Elapsed,AllocCPUS,CPUTime,TotalCPU

Remarks
-------

By default, sacct only shows your jobs for the current day. Options exist to show more jobs.
