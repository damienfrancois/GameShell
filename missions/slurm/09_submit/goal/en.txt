Mission goal
============

Now that the work order (submission script) is complete, it must be submitted to Slurm for background scheduling and allocation to a worker.

This is done with the sbatch command. 

If no error is found in the resource requests, Slurm will respond with a job ID. That ID will be used afterwards to refer to that job while querying its status, requeuing, or cancelling it for instance.

To pass this mission, submit the submit.sh script and note the job ID.
