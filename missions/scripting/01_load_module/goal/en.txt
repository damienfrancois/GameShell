Mission goal
============

Choose a scripting language (Octave, Python, R or Julia) and find and load the corresponding module.

Useful commands
===============

module load MODULE
  Loads module named MODULE in the environment.
  If you do not know what a module is, please refer to the documentation or the dedicated training session.

module spider MODULE
  Looks for a module named MODULE.

Remarks
-------

Beware that modules often have capital letters as their initial letter while the corresponding command might be all lower-case.

As far as the Python module is concerned, it is best to load the SciPy-bundle module, that contains already a set of packages dedicated to scientific computing.
