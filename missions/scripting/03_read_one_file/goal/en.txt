Mission goal
============

The files have a specific structure. They look like this:

    # Result file for experiment
    [main]

    parameter=0.01
    result=0.15492

    [meta]
    time=531244

This structure is called an "INI" file. It corresponds to a well-known standard with "sections" between square brackets and key-values pairs delimited by an = sign.

In all languages, this type of file can read and parsed directly using an existing package/module/extension.

To pass this mission, you will need to find out which extension of the language you chose offers that functionality, and create a small script that simply reads the first file (exercice2/res-1.txt) and outputs the value of "result".

Then run that script and use a pipe | to pass the output to gsh check

Read the documentation of the extension, and take advantage of the interactive interpreter to try and test the extention before you write the solution script.

Useful commands
===============

For Python and R, the extention is probably already included. 

See section 4 in the slides of the lecture for hints on how to install additional extensions.

For Octave, you will have to download a file and save it in the same directory.
For Julia, you will have to install the extension using the appropriate commands.

Remarks
-------

Once the extention is installed, you might need to 'activate it' using a keyword, like "import", "library", "using", etc.
