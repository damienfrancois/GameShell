Welcome to GameShell!

Discovering a programming language is best 
done with a small exercice. This gameshell
will guide you through the challenge offered
during the training session dedicated to 
scripting languages. 

The goal is to read multiple files that have a
specific internal structure and find the
minimum number among a set of values. 

Beware that outliers and NaNs will try
to make you fail in your quest!

You are free to choose the scripting language
that you want to discover.
