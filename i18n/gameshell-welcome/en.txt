Welcome to GameSlurm!

After your fascinating adventures in the command
line where you explored a castle in a forest and
met with wise and weird people, you realise that
the castle emplyes a set of worker gnomes hosted
in the stable.

They obey to their master Slurm the Great, or
Slurm for short.  Slurm organises their work based
on work orders that you can submit. The work order
must contain a description of the resources that
the gnomes will need to perform the job, and the
tasks that they must do.

Gnomes can work in teams, that is how they are the
strongest, and they are organised into partitions
based on their capabilities or policies that they
observe.

In this new adventures, you will learn how to
submit jobs to the workers using Slurm commands,
how to check that your work has been done as
intended, etc.
